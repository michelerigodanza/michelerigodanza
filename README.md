### Introduction

<p align="left">Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here you'll find a collection of my software projects. I'm passionate about programming and enjoy exploring various technological domains, so you'll find a variety of projects here, ranging from artificial intelligence and much more.</p>



**Welcome to My GitHub Projects!**


### Key Projects
1. **Tesi**
   - Description: Statistical analysis of the impact on air quality in some European cities of the restrictive measures due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
   - Technologies Used: Matlab
   - [Link to Tesi](https://github.com/michelerigodanza/michelerigodanza/tree/main/tesi)

2. **Deep learning**
   - Description: Some deep learning algorithms, particularly in computer vision and image generation.
   - Technologies Used: Tensorflow, Pytorch, matplotlib, keras...
   - in particular:
     * Multiple semantic segmentation of vegetation:
       Here is the complete code I used for semantic segmentation of satellite images (loading, image processing, jittering, data augmentation). The neural network is based on an MSUNet model. [Semantic Segmentation](https://github.com/michelerigodanza/michelerigodanza/tree/main/deep%20leaerning/segmentatazione%20semantica)
     * Binary semantic segmentation of streets:
       [streets segmentation](https://github.com/michelerigodanza/michelerigodanza/blob/main/deep%20leaerning/segmentazione%20strade.py)
     * Image generation:
       This neural network generates images of rocks drawn on technical maps of cartography. The model is a dcGan based on random noise.
       [Image generation](https://github.com/michelerigodanza/michelerigodanza/blob/main/deep%20leaerning/dcGAN%20rocce.py)
     * Animal Recognition:
       This model is a CNN that recognizes whether a dog or a cat is present in an image.
       [Animal Recognition](https://github.com/michelerigodanza/michelerigodanza/blob/main/deep%20leaerning/riconoscimento%20animali.py)
      * Number image generation:
       This neural network generates images of numbers. The model is a Gan trtained on MINST dataset.
       [Number generation](https://github.com/michelerigodanza/michelerigodanza/blob/main/deep%20leaerning/creazione%20numeri.py)
      
     

3. **electronic controllers**
   - Description: Project for the creation of a circuit (and 3D model of printed circuit board) of a low-pass filter.
   - Technologies Used: LTspice, Autodesk EAGLE
   - [electronic controllers](https://github.com/michelerigodanza/michelerigodanza/blob/main/progretto%20controllori%20elettronici/progettazione%20di%20un%20filtro%20passa%20basso.pdf)
